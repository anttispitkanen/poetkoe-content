## A wild Poetkoe has appeared!

Greetings from Antti "Poetkoe" Pitk√§nen, an independent artist, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist and producer from Tampere, Finland.

I write, play, record, produce and publish all my music myself. I play the guitar, bass and keys as well as sing, rap and occasionally beatbox. I also do all the electronics, programming, mixing and mastering of my music. The genres range from guitar rock to rap to instrumental prog to house, so there's something for everyone!

You can find Poetkoe on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/6GUQLqKG61jlmOfDpIATq7?si=qOWuBhCaRJ2L-7OwZZM5JQ" target="_blank">Spotify</a>!
