## A wild Poetkoe has appeared!

I'm Antti "Poetkoe" Pitk√§nen, an independent artist, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist and producer from Tampere, Finland.

I write, play, record, produce and publish all my music myself. I play the guitar, bass and keys as well as sing, rap and occasionally beatbox. I also do all the electronics, programming, mixing and mastering.
